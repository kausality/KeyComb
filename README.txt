KeyComb is a pattern matching tool.

It matches what you type on the keyboard with a predefined string. For example:
If you have the set the to-match string to "github" then whenever someone types github
you can show a message box with your message or execute a command or run a program.

It also emulates backspace key. So g-i-t-h-y-[Backspace]-u-b will also match github.

It's application depends on your imagination :)
