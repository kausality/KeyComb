KeyComb is a pattern matching tool.

Suppose you have a naughty little brother and he searches for all naughty 
things on the web and you want to freak him out then KeyComb is the tool you
are looking for!

Let's suppose he searches for the word "basic instinct" on the web and you
know what really he is looking for ,so you start KeyComb and feed it the pattern
"basic instinct"....now whenever someone types this word then bang!

KeyComb can display message box or execute any commands when that pattern is typed.
So KeyComb is a nice little tool to have much fun!
I use it to display some warning message to these peoples to freak them out and they
don't dare once again to do that again because now they think that this 
computer is under surveillance.


All input to the program is intercative and simple...so happy freaking ;)
